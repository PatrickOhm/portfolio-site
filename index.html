                            <p>Lists DnD is a tool to manage tasks, similar to trello. The application can be used to
                                create lists and tasks.
                                With the drag and drop functionality it's possible to rearrange the content as desired.
                                For the implementation
                                I used react, redux and react-beautiful-dnd. I tried to give the UI a clean minimalistic
                                look, I used TailwindCSS
                                for that.

                                activities. With just one click, you can start tracking your progress in real-time.
                                Creating a new timer is simple -
                                just name your timer and start it. You can easily make changes to or delete timers as
                                needed. My application is
                                customizable and user-friendly, making it a great tool for managing your time and
                                tracking your daily tasks.</p>

                                get burned from the lava, you start from the beginning an try again. While the first
                                levels are easy as pie, the difficulty level increases fast. Patience and skill are
                                required.

                                found two identical cards, they disappear from the display and you get a get a point. In
                                total there are 12 cards, you have to get 6 points to bring the game to the end. Its a
                                simple game to challenge yourself. Play again and beat your record time and your total
